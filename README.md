**RoboMasterPy** is a Python SDK and framework for RoboMaster EP.

The SDK(client) is straightforward to use:

```python
>>> import robomasterpy as rm

# IP of RoboMaster is detected under router mode
>>> cmd = rm.Commander()

# check RoboMaster's API version
>>> cmd.version()
'version 00.00.00.60'

>>> cmd.get_robot_mode()
'chassis_lead'

# ensure your Robomaster has enough room to move
>>> cmd.chassis_move(x=-1, z=30)
'ok'

# activate video streaming,
# which can be handled by the framework.
>>> cmd.stream(rm.SWITCH_ON)
'ok'

# activate gimbal attitude push at 5Hz,
# which can be handled by the framework.
>>> cmd.gimbal_push_on(attitude_freq=5)
'ok'

# Watch out!
>>> cmd.blaster_fire()
'ok'
```

The framework deals with video streaming, push and event,
provides a high-level interface for controlling and communication.
You can build your controlling logic basing on it.
